            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Timbuk2 + Blue Bottle's Sabbatical Travel Kit</h1><p>If the recent buyouts of Intelligentsia and Stumptown are any indication, the growing popularity of craft coffee shows no signs of slowing down. While single origin pour-overs are now commonplace in many coffeeshops, sometimes when you're off the beaten path, your morning cup of coffee is harder to perfect.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ba000655e6b2a554855a55a3bfaa786ed97ccb09.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Collection of Exciting New Booze Books</h1><p>It seems like just about everyone has a cookbook, cocktail manual or spirits' history guide out on the market.

Most recently we've been digging through four new offerings and each is very different from the next.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8dbd52c022b397f706e88ffffb31a04f102faa7c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Illustration</h1><p>As part of his Celestial Series, Chicago-based digital artist David Brodeur rendered an alien world filled with berry-like plants, glowing crystals, and candy shaped orbs that sprout from the ground. Despite their exotic designs, Brodeur relies on common colors of familiar fruits to create this Willy Wonka-esque habitat where you can't help but want to reach out and gobble everything up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4d6c337dd3c98bcadd87c6b27fd94f1493ae65eb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
